A 'taxon' (pl. 'taxa') is a taxonomic group at any rank.

homologs: sequences have common ancestry.
Orthologs separated by a speciation event.
Paralogs separated by a duplication event.
Xenologs separated by a horitontal gene transfer (HGT) event.
Orthology and paralogy are the most frequent homologs.

species phylogeny
gene phylogeny

Detecting orthologous, paralogous and xenologs relationships requires a species tree and a gene tree for the gene family in questionã€‚

Orthogroup: the set of genes from a single gene in the last common ancestor of all the species being considered. (homologs in a group of species)
Predicted orthogroups can be thought of as predicted gene/protein families.
